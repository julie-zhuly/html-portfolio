    <h1>Movies I Enjoyed in Summer 2023</h1>
    <h2>Random 3</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Spider Man</h3>
    <p>The art is very cool and unique. So creative with different spider men in different universes.</p>
    <h3>Barbie</h3>
    <p>Great marketing. I love the pink. To be honest, I did not understand many words and jokes while watching.</p>
    <h3>Flash</h3>
    <p>It touched me when Flash wanted to go back to save his mom. However, what makes him a superhero is not saving his
        mom, but saving the world by choosing not to save his mom.</p>
